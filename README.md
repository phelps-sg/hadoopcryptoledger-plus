# hadoopcryptoledger-plus

This is a library of components allowing raw files from crypto wallets to be loaded into big data frameworks
such as Hadoop and Apache Spark.  The core classes provide implementations of Hadoop's [`RecordReader`](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/RecordReader.html) interface, allowing, e.g. raw `blk*.dat` files to be easily loaded into Apache Spark.

The library is a fork of ZuInnoTe/hadoopcryptoledger enhanced with:

- additional functionality to compute BTC block hashes and addresses as they appear in conventional block explorers.  
- representation of unsigned 32-bit values, such as block nonce and time, with full range.

In addition to providing the above features, this fork of the library aims to provide a simpler, 
cleaner API adhering to object-oriented design principles; in particular:

- fewer static methods
- cleaner exception handling
- simpler unit-tests
- refactoring of duplicated code
- adherence to Java style guide
